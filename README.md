# VBACodeWriter
Enhance Productivity when writing VBA Code in Microsoft Access using speech recognition.

For example when you need to type the name of a Table, Query, Form, or Report but you can't remember the exact name used. You can say for example list of tables, and a list of tables will appear and you can enter a search term further limit the search then select the one you want and it will be pasted into the current code position.

You can also drill down from table to field names.

You can also get the same functionality with the current variables in the current procedure.
